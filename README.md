You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash!
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that
the frontend developers can demo out some initial design ideas to the big bosses.

![GrubDash](https://res.cloudinary.com/strive/image/upload/w_1000,h_1000,c_limit/1fc7f916e2146e659f7934a73b103e25-home.png)
### Learning objectives
This project will test your ability to build APIs with complex validation. Before taking on this project, you should be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below:

- Running tests from the command line
- Using common middleware packages
- Receiving requests through routes
- Accessing relevant information through route parameters
- Building an API following RESTful design principles
- Writing custom middleware functions
- You will not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

### GrubDash Frontend
[https://github.com/NolaDodd/starter-grub-dash-front-end](https://github.com/NolaDodd/GrubDash-Frontend)

Instructions on how to get the frontend application up and running are included in the repository.

## Running tests
To run the tests, you can run the following command:

### npm test
#### Instructions
Your goal for this lesson is to get the tests to pass.
To do so, you will be creating a server to access two resources, dishes and orders, in addition to error handling.
Your server should follow the structure that you've learned in the program. Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

#### Existing files
File path	Description
- src/app.js	Contains the Express application. You will not need to make changes to this file.
- src/data/dishes-data.js	Contains the dishes data. This is the shape of the dish data that the API will send and receive. You can add or remove dishes if you like.
- src/data/orders-data.js	Contains the orders data. This is the shape of the order data that the API will send and receive. You can add or remove orders if you like.
- src/dishes/dishes.controller.js	Add middleware and handlers for dishes to this file, then export the functions for use by the router.
- src/dishes/dishes.router.js	Add routes and attach handlers to the router exported by this file.
- src/errors/errorHandler.js	Exports the error handler function for use by the Express application.
- src/errors/methodNotAllowed.js	Exports the 405 Method Not Allowed handler function for use by the Express application.
- src/errors/notFound.js	Exports the 404 Not Found handler function for use by the Express application.
- src/orders/orders.controller.js	Add middleware and handlers for orders to this file, then export the functions for use by the router.
- src/orders/orders.router.js	Add routes and attach handlers to the router exported by this file.
- src/server.js	Contains the server code. You will not need to make changes to this file.
- src/utils/nextId.js	Exports the nextId function. Use this function anytime you need to assign a new id. You will not need to make changes to this file.
- test/dishes-router.test.js	Tests for the dishes router. You will not need to make changes to this file.
- test/order-router.test.js	Tests for the orders router. You will not need to make changes to this file.
- test/make-test-app.js	Function used by the tests. You will not need to make changes to this file.

#### Tasks
- In the src/dishes/dishes.controller.js file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, and list dishes. Note that dishes cannot be deleted.
- In the src/dishes/dishes.router.js file, add two routes: /dishes, and /dishes/:dishId and attach the handlers (create, read, update, and list) exported from src/dishes/dishes.controller.js.
- In the src/orders/orders.controller.js file, add handlers and middleware functions to create, read, update, delete, and list orders.
- In the src/orders/orders.router.js file, add two routes: /orders, and /orders/:orderId and attach the handlers (create, read, update, delete, and list) exported from src/orders/orders.controller.js.
- Anytime you need to assign a new id to an order or dish, use the nextId function exported from src/utils/nextId.js

#### Routes
To complete this project, you will create the following routes:

**GET /dishes**
This route will respond with a list of all existing dish data.

Example request

> GET http://localhost:5000/dishes
Example response
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "d351db2b49b69679504652ea1cf38241",
      "name": "Dolcelatte and chickpea spaghetti",
      "description": "Spaghetti topped with a blend of dolcelatte and fresh chickpeas",
      "price": 19,
      "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1279330/pexels-photo-1279330.jpeg?h=530&w=350"
    }
  ]
}
```
**POST /dishes**

This route will save the dish and respond with the newly created dish.

Validation: If any of the following validations fail, respond with a status code of 400 and an error message.
- name property is missing = Dish must include a name
- name property is empty ""	= Dish must include a name
- description property is missing	= Dish must include a description
- description property is empty ""	= Dish must include a description
- price property is missing	= Dish must include a price

- price property is not an integer = Dish must have a price that is an integer greater than 0
- image_url property is missing	= Dish must include a image_url
- image_url property is empty ""	= Dish must include a image_url

Example request

- id in the body does not match :dishId in the route	= Dish id does not match route id. Dish: ${id}, Route: ${dishId}
- Note: The id property isn't required in the body of the request, but if it is present, it must match :dishId from the route.

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**POST /orders**

This route will save the order and respond with the newly created order.

Validation: If any of the following validations fail, respond with a status code of 400 and an error message.

- deliverTo property is missing	= Order must include a deliverTo
- deliverTo property is empty ""	= Order must include a deliverTo
- mobileNumber property is missing	= Order must include a mobileNumber
- mobileNumber property is empty ""	= Order must include a mobileNumber

- A dish quantity property is not an integer	= dish ${index} must have a quantity that is an integer greater than 0
Example request

> POST http://localhost:5000/orders
Body:
``` 
{
  "data": {
    "deliverTo": "308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, NM",
    "mobileNumber": "(505) 143-3369",
    "status": "delivered",
    "dishes": [
      {
        "id": "d351db2b49b69679504652ea1cf38241",
        "name": "Dolcelatte and chickpea spaghetti",
        "description": "Spaghetti topped with a blend of dolcelatte and fresh chickpeas",

        "price": 19,
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
``` 
Note: Each dish in the Order's dishes property is a complete copy of the dish, rather than a reference to the dish by ID. This is so the order does not change retroactively if the dish data is updated some time after the order is created.
